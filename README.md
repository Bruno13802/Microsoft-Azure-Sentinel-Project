# Azure Sentinel Honeypot Project  

This project was created as my college final project, where I set up a honeypot in Microsoft Azure to capture and analyze malicious login attempts. Using Azure Sentinel, I visualized failed RDP logins on a world map to show the origin of attacks in real time.  

I presented this project in front of the Head of Computer Science at my college and successfully passed with an **A**.

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works  

1. **Virtual Machine Setup**  
   - Deployed a Windows VM in Microsoft Azure.  
   - Left RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) port open to attract attackers.  

2. **Data Collection**  
   - Configured Azure to log failed login attempts.  
   - Captured malicious activity targeting the honeypot.  

3. **Azure Sentinel Integration**  
   - Connected logs to Azure Sentinel.  
   - Built a map visualization to display attack sources by IP/location.  

4. **Presentation**  
   - Showed real-world attack data in front of faculty.  
   - Demonstrated how attackers constantly scan and attempt logins.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Skills Learned  
- Cloud security monitoring with **Azure Sentinel**  
- Log analysis & visualization  
- Honeypot deployment for cybersecurity research

## ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements  
- Add automated alerts for suspicious login patterns.  
- Deploy multiple honeypots (Windows & Linux) for broader attack data.  
- Integrate with a SIEM outside of Azure for cross-platform monitoring.
